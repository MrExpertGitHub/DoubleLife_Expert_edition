# DoubleLife
The public version of my Double Life plugin!  
Never heard of Double Life before? It's a fun twist on minecraft hardcore, where every player will have their health linked with another (random) player!
You start off with three lives, and you're only allowed to kill people when you're on one life!

I recommend that you watch this video if you've never heard of the game before.
